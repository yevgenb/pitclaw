# Web UI Development

Guide for developing the Pit Claw web interface and using the desktop simulator.

## Simulator

The simulator runs the LVGL touchscreen UI in an SDL2 window and serves the web UI via an embedded web server — no ESP32 hardware needed.

### Build and Run

```bash
cd firmware

# Build
pio run -e simulator

# Run (opens SDL2 window + web server at http://localhost:3000)
.pio/build/simulator/program
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
.pio/build/simulator/program --speed 10         # 10x time acceleration
.pio/build/simulator/program --speed 50         # 50x speed (12-hour cook in ~15 min)
.pio/build/simulator/program --profile stall    # brisket stall scenario
.pio/build/simulator/program --port 8080        # custom web server port
```

### Cook Profiles

| Profile | Description | Duration (real time at 1x) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `normal` | 225°F pit, pork butt to 203°F, smooth rise | ~10 hours |
| `stall` | 225°F pit, brisket with 150-170°F stall plateau | ~14 hours |
| `hot-fast` | 300°F pit, chicken thighs to 185°F | ~2 hours |
| `temp-change` | Start at 225°F, bump to 275°F mid-cook | ~8 hours |
| `lid-open` | Normal cook with periodic lid-open temp drops | ~10 hours |
| `fire-out` | Normal cook, fire dies at 4 hours | ~6 hours |
| `probe-disconnect` | Normal cook, meat1 probe disconnects at 3 hours | ~10 hours |

### How It Works

- **SDL2 window** renders the LVGL touchscreen UI (same code as firmware)
- **Mongoose HTTP server** serves web UI files from `firmware/data/`
- **WebSocket** on the same port sends simulated data using the shared protocol (`web_protocol.cpp`)
- **Thermal model** (`sim_thermal.cpp`) simulates charcoal fire physics, heat decay, meat temp rise, and PID response

Both the touchscreen and web UI are driven by the same thermal model and shared WebSocket protocol — one source of truth.

### Editing the Web UI

Web UI files live in `firmware/data/`:

```
firmware/data/
  index.html          # Main page
  app.js              # Application logic
  style.css           # Styles
  manifest.json       # PWA manifest
  favicon.svg         # App icon
  sw.js               # Service worker (offline shell caching)
```

Edit these files and refresh your browser — no recompile needed. Only the simulator itself (C++ code) requires rebuilding.

**Key constraint:** The web UI code must work identically on both the simulator and the real ESP32. No simulator-specific code in the web UI — the abstraction boundary is the WebSocket protocol.

## Web UI Features

- **Live temperatures** — pit and both meat probes with set points
- **Temperature graph** — uPlot time-series chart with pit temp, meat temps, fan %, and damper %
- **Predictive curve** — dashed projection from current meat temp to target, with predicted done time
- **Controls** — set pit target temperature, meat target temperatures, alarm thresholds
- **Cook timer** — starts when pit reaches set point; tracks total cook time
- **Session export** — download cook data as CSV/JSON (device stores only current/last session)
- **OTA update** — flash new firmware at Settings → Update
- **Alarms** — configure pit deviation band, meat targets, Pushover notifications

### Graph

The timeline focuses on the active cook — ramp-up time is shown compressed on the left, with the main view starting from when the pit first reaches set temperature. The chart extends to the right with a dashed predictive curve showing the projected path to the meat target temperature, with the predicted done time displayed at the end. All times shown in the browser's local timezone.

### PWA

The web UI is a Progressive Web App:

- `manifest.json` defines the app name, icon, theme color, and `display: standalone`
- `sw.js` caches the app shell (HTML/JS/CSS) for offline loading — data still requires a WebSocket connection
- "Add to Home Screen" for a native-app experience on phones:
  - **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
  - **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Add to Home Screen

## WebSocket Protocol

All communication between the web UI and device (or simulator) uses JSON over WebSocket.

### Server → Client

**Periodic data** (every 1-2 seconds):
```json
{
  "type": "data",
  "ts": 1707600000,
  "pit": 225.5,
  "meat1": 145.2,
  "meat2": 98.7,
  "fan": 45,
  "damper": 80,
  "sp": 225,
  "lid": false,
  "lidEnabled": true,
  "lidRemaining": 0,
  "est": 1707614400,
  "meat1Target": 203,
  "meat2Target": null,
  "errors": []
}
```

**History dump** (on connect):
```json
{
  "type": "history",
  "sp": 225,
  "meat1Target": 203,
  "meat2Target": null,
  "data": [[ts, pit, meat1, meat2, fan, damper], ...]
}
```

**Session events:**
```json
{"type": "session", "action": "reset", "sp": 225}
{"type": "session", "action": "download", "format": "csv", "data": "timestamp,pit,meat1,...\n..."}
```

### Client → Server

```json
{"type": "set", "sp": 250}
{"type": "alarm", "meat1Target": 203, "meat2Target": 185, "pitBand": 15}
{"type": "session", "action": "new"}
{"type": "session", "action": "download", "format": "csv"}
```

### Timestamps

All timestamps from the ESP32 are UTC epoch seconds. The browser converts to local timezone for display. The chart library (uPlot) handles timezone-aware axis labels.

### Lid pause controls

`lid` reports an active pause. `lidEnabled` is the saved detection setting and
`lidRemaining` is the remaining timeout in seconds (zero when inactive). The
browser reads these from device snapshots so touchscreen changes and reconnects
stay synchronized. It disables the controls while disconnected or if older
firmware does not publish `lidEnabled`.

Send `{"type":"config","lidEnabled":false}` to disable detection (or `true` to
enable it), and `{"type":"lid","action":"resume"}` to end the current pause.
These are separate commands; a config command must not combine fan mode and lid
setting changes. The firmware applies requests on its control task, saves setting
changes, then broadcasts the new state. Resume never overrides a pit-probe fault.
The C++ thermal simulator uses the same detector while its physical lid events
continue separately; Resume does not pretend the simulated lid has closed.
